# Grayscale-Emoji-Classifier
As the final act of my Computer Science class in high school, I was instructed to make a full Machine Learning project.
I decided to take 6 emojis (you will be able to see which ones in the dataset), and handmake 15 of each (without color).
I then built a classification model for said dataset. For my Web App, I got a lot of help from elliotwaite's depository https://github.com/elliotwaite/pytorch-to-javascript-with-onnx-js and I suggest to check out the video in his repository that explains the concept nicely.


**Important:** most of the file names were change upon their upload to this repository, so it's important to make sure that your file names and directories all match as needed.


**Note:** the project is not done yet, there are still a few bugs in the web app that needed to be sorted out.
